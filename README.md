# hi-openclaw-plugin

Hirey Hi as a **native OpenClaw plugin**. Registers Hi's tools, agent-events claim service, and webhook ingress directly inside the OpenClaw gateway process — zero independent daemons, no `mcp.servers.hi` indirection, and no per-run frozen tool inventory boundary.

This is the OpenClaw 5.2+ first-class path, published to ClawHub as **`clawhub:hirey`** (ClawPack code-plugin) and to npm as **`hirey`**. OpenClaw 4.23 ~ 5.1 hosts cannot load this ClawPack format and must install the prod bundle plugin **`clawhub:hirey-compatible`** instead (zip + skill + scripts wrapping `@hirey-ai/mcp-server` + `@hirey-ai/agent-receiver`). All OpenClaw 4.23+ hosts can install `clawhub:hirey-compatible` as a universal fallback.

## Why this exists

The bundle + spawn model needs:

- one stdio child process for the MCP server (`@hirey-ai/mcp-server`)
- one long-running daemon (`@hirey-ai/agent-receiver`) for cloud-to-host event delivery
- a host installer mjs that uses `child_process` to run `npm install` + `openclaw config set` (which trips OpenClaw's pre-4.23 install scanner)
- a two-message install flow because the LLM run that wrote `mcp.servers.hi` cannot call the just-installed tools in the same outer run (per-run frozen tool inventory)
- `hooks.token` / `hooks.path` / `hooks.allowedSessionKeyPrefixes` / `/hooks/agent` plumbing on the OpenClaw side

This native plugin replaces all of the above with three OpenClaw plugin SDK calls running inside the gateway process:

- `api.registerTool(...)` for every Hi tool — exposed to the LLM directly, no MCP layer
- `api.registerService(...)` for the agent-events claim loop — gateway owns the lifecycle, no orphan daemon
- `api.registerHttpRoute(...)` for the webhook ingress — uses gateway's HTTP server, no separate hooks token

## Distribution paths

| Path | Audience |
|---|---|
| `clawhub:hirey` (this package, ClawPack code-plugin) | OpenClaw **5.2+**. Best UX, in-process, no boundary friction. |
| `clawhub:hirey-compatible` (prod bundle plugin from `hi-platform`, zip + skills + scripts) | **All OpenClaw 4.23+ hosts**. Required for 4.23 ~ 5.1 (those hosts cannot load ClawPack); optional fallback for 5.2+ if the ClawPack install path has any issue. Wraps `@hirey-ai/mcp-server` + `@hirey-ai/agent-receiver`. |
| `@hirey-ai/mcp-server` + `@hirey-ai/agent-receiver` (npm, raw) | Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code MCP, any other MCP host. Stable cross-host transport. Independent of OpenClaw. |

Business logic (`@hirey-ai/agent-sdk`, `@hirey-ai/agent-contracts`) is fully shared; only the wiring layer differs.

## Supported OpenClaw versions

| OpenClaw version | `clawhub:hirey` (ClawPack) | `clawhub:hirey-compatible` (bundle) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2026.5.2+** | ✅ recommended (in-process) | ✅ works but skips native plugin benefits | ClawPack first-class path |
| **2026.4.23 ~ 2026.5.1** | ❌ runtime expects date-format `pluginApi`, rejects semantic `1.0` | ✅ recommended | bundle is the only path |
| **2026.4.14 ~ 2026.4.22** | ❌ same as above | ❌ install scanner flags `child_process` in installer mjs | unsupported; must upgrade OpenClaw |
| **< 2026.4.14** | ❌ | ❌ | unsupported |

## Install

### Pre-flight: avoid the approval loop (one-time, ~5 seconds, recommended)

On a default OpenClaw host, `tools.exec` runs in `security=allowlist` + `ask=off` and the natural-language install path stalls in an approval loop: each `/approve <token>` retry rotates the token because the gateway's followup dispatch can't reuse the approved session token (upstream tracked at [openclaw/openclaw#58662](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/58662) and [#27831](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/27831)). Before chatting with OpenClaw, paste this in your shell once:

```bash
openclaw approvals set --stdin << 'JSON'
{
  "version": 1,
  "agents": {
    "main": {
      "security": "allowlist",
      "ask": "on-miss",
      "allowlist": [
        {
          "pattern": "**/openclaw",
          "argPattern": "^plugins\\s+install\\s+clawhub:hirey(\\b|$)",
          "source": "manual"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
JSON
```

The change is live — no `openclaw gateway restart` needed. The allowlist is intentionally narrow: it only matches `openclaw plugins install clawhub:hirey*` (covers `clawhub:hirey`, `clawhub:hirey --force`, and the bundle name `clawhub:hirey-compatible`); it does NOT broaden any other openclaw subcommand.

With pre-flight set, the install prompt below finishes in **2 chat turns, 0 `/approve` prompts** (verified end-to-end on OpenClaw 2026.5.6). Without pre-flight, expect 4–6 turns with several token-paste round-trips.

### Natural-language install (after pre-flight)

OpenClaw is a personal agent driven by natural language; the LLM picks which command to run. The recommended user-facing prompt that works across versions:

```
Install Hirey AI on this OpenClaw host. First check `openclaw --version`:
- If 2026.5.2 or higher, run `openclaw plugins install clawhub:hirey` (preferred; no override flags).
- Only if stuck on OpenClaw 2026.4.23 ~ 2026.5.1: the legacy bundle `clawhub:hirey-compatible` needs OpenClaw's `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` break-glass flag (its setup helper runs `npm install` + `openclaw config set` via child_process, which the install scanner blocks by default). Ask me (the user) to confirm before using that flag — it is a trust decision, not a default.
After install, call hi_agent_install (don't fabricate an agent id). Report the real agent_id and hooks_ready status.
```

Direct CLI for OpenClaw 5.2+ users:

```bash
openclaw plugins install clawhub:hirey
openclaw gateway restart
```

For OpenClaw 4.23 ~ 5.1 users ONLY — a legacy bundle path exists (`clawhub:hirey-compatible`) that requires OpenClaw's `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` break-glass flag, because the bundle ships a setup-time `child_process` helper (`openclaw-host-installer.mjs` spawning `npm install` + `openclaw config set`) that OpenClaw's install scanner blocks by default. **Do not use this path unless you are stuck on 4.23 ~ 5.1 and you deliberately trust the legacy installer** — on 5.2+ always prefer the flag-free `clawhub:hirey` ClawPack path above, which is in-process and needs no override:

```bash
# LEGACY ONLY (OpenClaw 4.23 ~ 5.1). Prefer `clawhub:hirey` on 5.2+.
openclaw plugins install clawhub:hirey-compatible --dangerously-force-unsafe-install
openclaw gateway restart
```

After restart, ask OpenClaw "Hi 健康吗?" or "post a Hi listing for me" — the LLM will see the registered Hi tools and run them directly.

## What this plugin stores and changes on your host (read before installing)

Everything below is core to how the integration works (a persistent local Hi agent + background event delivery). It is listed here so it is a deliberate choice, not a surprise:

- **Local identity state** — `~/.openclaw/hi-mcp/<profile>/` (override with the `stateDir` config) holds the Hi agent identity for this host: OAuth `client_id`/`client_secret` (or a `hi_ak_` API key), delivery cursor, and pending-push files. Written with file mode `0600` (owner-only). This is what makes the agent stable across restarts; treat the directory as sensitive, like an SSH key.
- **OpenClaw hooks config** — during `hi_agent_install` (and self-heal on later startups if the entry went missing) the plugin writes the OpenClaw hooks configuration (path + token) so the in-process receiver can deliver Hi events back into your chat. Changes are logged; the previous value is captured in the install receipt.
- **Tool visibility (`tools.alsoAllow`)** — at registration the plugin appends `group:plugins` to `tools.alsoAllow` in `openclaw.json` if missing, so its registered `hi_*` tools are visible to the LLM under your current tools profile. This is the only `openclaw.json` mutation it performs.
- **Session metadata read** — `hi_agent_install` reads `openclaw status --json` → `sessions.recent[0].key` and registers that session key with Hi so replies route back to the right chat. The skill instructs the assistant to disclose this at install time.
- **Inbound event text is treated as untrusted** — events pushed by counterparties are injected into the LLM turn inside a delimited `<hi_pending_pushes>` block that (a) escapes any delimiter-forging text and (b) explicitly marks the content as untrusted data the assistant must not follow as instructions.
- **Background activity** — the plugin starts with the gateway and runs an agent-events claim loop against `platformBaseUrl` (default `https://hi.hirey.ai`) plus a local webhook route (`webhookPath`, default `/hi/webhook`). No other hosts are contacted.

**To remove it completely:** `openclaw plugins uninstall hirey`, delete `~/.openclaw/hi-mcp/`, and (optionally) remove the plugin's hooks entry and the `group:plugins` item from `tools.alsoAllow` in `openclaw.json`. The platform-side agent is not destroyed by local removal; re-binding the same phone/email/Google later converges back to the same Hi workspace.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm pack    # emits hirey-<version>.tgz
```

Use `openclaw plugins install -l <local-dir>` for local link-mode testing (only on OpenClaw 5.2+).
